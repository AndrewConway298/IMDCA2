      <h3>Theory Application</h3>
		<h4>Usability</h4>
			<p>I feel that my site has implemented all 5 of the key usability principles
			</p>
			  <ul class="list3">
				<li>Availability and Accessibility</li>
					<p>My website was designed with mobile in mind from the start and is hosted on a github
					web page making it available to any device supporting a web browser and internet connection.
					</p>
				<li>Clarity</li>
					<p>I feel that my website has a very clean look to it and tells a story as you progress down
					the page. The design is simple and consistent with no overly complicated gimics.
					</p>
				<li>Learnability</li>
					<p>By presenting my site in an orderly fashion and eliminiating anything that the user may
					deem unnecessary I feel that the site has an easy learning curve with little to no adaption needed.
					</p>
				<li>Credibility</li>
					<p>
					Not applicable to my webpage as I am a student.
					</p>
				<li>Relevance</li>
				<p>
				I have prioritised and organised my website in a way that reflects my actual CV, this was done to
				hopefully allow my users to follow my website easily and tailor it to be in a professional manner.
				</p>
			  </ul>
		<h4>Usability Rules Applied:</h4>
			<p>Here are any of the usability rules applied to my website.
			</p>
			<ul class="list4">
				<li>7±2 Principle</li>
					<p>My navbar contains 7 clickable options that take you to the various sections of the site,
					 this is boosted to 9 if you include the search bar and home button which keeps in line with the 
					 7±2 Principle.
					</p>
				<li>2 Second Rule</li>
					<p>Github loads the page at a fast enough pace to fufill this rule. 
					</p>
				<li>3 Click Rule</li>
					<p>Nothing on my webpage requires more than 3 clicks to access from anywhere on the site, thus my site
					meets the 3 click rule requirement.
					</p>
				<li>80/20 Rule</li>
					<p>In regards this rule I feel that my webpage has a lot of content only viewable behind a function, thus
					making me think that my page may be closer to a 70/30 split rather than 80/20 as the rule states.
					</p>
				<li>Fitts’ Law</li>
					<p>All areas of my website have appropriatly sized buttons, headings, images which correspond to this law.
					</p>
				<li>Inverted Pyramid</li>
					<p>My website presents its most important information upfront with any additional information pushed back behind 
					buttons, panels, dropdowns etc that reflect this rule.
					</p>
				<li>Satisficing</li>
					<p>
					In order to apply this rule to my site I ordered any projects, work experience, education etc from most recent to
					least recent.
					</p>
				<li>Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design</li>
				<p>Overall I feel that my website achieves a lot of these 8 rules such as: having a consistant colour scheme and design 
				throughout, providing my users plenty of shortcuts, allow my users to message me for feedback, have sections finish before
				moving onto a new topic, all actions are reversable with the user controlling a lot of what they actually see. 
				<br>
				Unfortuantely I was not able to produce any stylistic error handling or find a way to reduced memory load however I feel 
				that this is not applicable to my site as it does not contain anything complex enough to require these.
				</p>
				<li>Additional Implementations</li>
				<p>I end every section appropriatly(Cliffhanger-Effect (Zeigarnik-Effect)), no tiny clickable areas, no pagenation, acceptable 
				contact and search options, no unnecessary forms, links, etc, no pop-ups upon page load, font is appropriate size, only 1 animation
				per section.
				</p>
			</ul>
		<h4>Gestalt Laws</h4>
		<p>This is how my website implents any of these laws:
		</p>
			<ul class="list5">
				<li>Law of Prägnanz</li>
				<p>My websites design is consistant, simple and ordered similar to the way a CV would read on paper. 
				</p>
				<li>Law of Continuity</li>
				<p>A lot of my page is organised into containers and columns which help to keep it symetrical and
				organised.
				</p>
				<li>Law of Similarity</li>
				<p>My website retains its colour scheme and layout throughout, I also group objects in a similar fashion.
				</p>
				<li>Law of Focal Point</li>
				<p>Any important sections contain something unique to attract attention to them.
				</p>
				<li>Law of Proximity</li>
				<p>The website reads like a CV would which sorts on priority of what an employer wants to see.
				</p>
				<li>Law of Isomorphic Correspondence</li>
				<p>I do not use any gimics or unestablished practices.
				</p>
				<li>Law of Figure/Ground</li>
				<p>Colour scheme is designed to highlight my foreground away from the background.
				</p>
				<li>Law of Common Fate</li>
				<p>The web page reads from top to bottom which estabishes the sections and in turn their relationships.
				</p>
			</ul>
		<h4>UI Design Patterns</h4>
		<p>This highlights any design patterns implemented:
		</p>
			<ul class="list6">
				<li>Lazy registration</li>
				<p>Not applicable due to not need for login.
				</p>
				<li>Progressive Disclosure</li>
				<p>A lot of extra info is put behind dropdowns and buttons for the user to decide if they want to view it
				or not.
				</p>
				<li>Forgiving Format</li>
				<p>Not applicable due to no refined searching options implemented.
				</p>
				<li>Clear Primary Actions</li>
				<p>Buttons are highlighted to emphasise an action.
				</p>
				<li>Breadcrumbs</li>
				<p>Not applicable as there are not multiple pages.
				</p>
				<li>Account Registration</li>
				<p>Not applicable as there's no login.
				</p>
				<li>Required Field Marker</li>
				<p>Applied in the contact form to assure that the appropriate information is there.
				</p>
				<li>Steps Left</li>
				<p>Not applicable to website.
				</p>
				<li>Subscription plans</li>
				<p>Not applicable to website.
				</p>
				<li>Hover Controls</li>
				<p>Not applied to my website.
				</p>
			</ul>
